\chapter*{Abstract} % Abstract name

In IT industry, in term of project management, there are various choices of solution for management tools \eg Redmine, FreshDesk, ProjectLibre, LibrePlan, OpenProject, ProjectOpen etc...
They can cover most of organization's needs, including security.
However, at the time of writing this document, none of those solutions covers protecting information in a multi level environment, \ie many roles, \eg developers, designer, manager, CEO etc..., working on a same system, which is a typical situation in most of companies. 

Thinking about MLS, it is a system where many users with different clearance level can use a same system (or machine) without exposing their data to unreasonable users.
For example, a user with \emph{roles} of programmer is very unlikely to need to know about designers' documents;
a programmer with \emph{security level} 'secret' should not be able to read 'top secret' documents.
These predefined accessing rules help to prevent data among the system to be mishandled, or leaked to insufficent people.
There are several MLS models, and due to the popularity, we are going to consider Bell-LaPadula model in the rest of this article.

This project's idea is to create a web platform for project management implementing MLS.
Since using MLS sometimes is complicated and expensive, the goal of this project is to help organizations to benefit from MLS work flow while reducing its complexity.
In developing progress, I will try to record all the problems both technically and logically of implementing Bell-LaPadula model into a project management tool, as well as the solutions for them if possible.
Remaining limitations, and trade-offs should also be recorded and explained for later development.
The key feature of this tool is to control accessibility of documents of an organization where many subjects with various roles can work and share documents centrally; the list of advantages using MLS will be introduced in more details in later chapter.
