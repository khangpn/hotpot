MLS is a very popular term in security field, which means every subjects (\ie users) has different roles in a same system; so that corresponding to their role, the subject will have distinct security level to access to suitable data sources to perform their jobs. In later chapters, We will explain more detailed about it. This is a very common scenario of most of IT-related projects where many roles (\eg\,developers, designers, project managers, customers etc.) work together sharing the same data source. While almost every existing project management tools focus on productivity, accessibility of the project; some of services \eg\,FreshDesk even provides further data protection (authentication, data integrity etc.); however, not many projects realize how well MLS satisfies the scenario of multi-roles project management, and it could be used as a skeleton for a PM tool to help us have a advanced sign about PM and innumerable assets for our projects which we will see later.

The goal of this project is to build a PM tool which embeds MLS as the core security principal.
