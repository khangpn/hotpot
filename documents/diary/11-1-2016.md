1. Add breadcrums
1. Change the directory logic: now not allow switching between article and directory mode. Delete directory will delete all of its children
1. Do some design
1. Some ideas about the logging system

## Problems and Solutions
### Task 2
- Not support nested directory.
- Not support article moving (to different directory). In the future, this requires a lot of work.
  + Check the dest exists.
  + Compare article security and roles against directory.
  + Security level must be gte to directory.
  + Roles must be sub collection of directory roles (directory roles must include all article roles).
- Not allow switching between article and directory.
### Task 3
#### LEARNING
`res.locals.<variable>` can be accessed from views by `<variable>` only.

### Task 4
- The tool can be more powerful if admins can monitor the access log.
- All the security violation (401 error) should be logged in database.
- A monitoring and analyzing tool access to those logs.
