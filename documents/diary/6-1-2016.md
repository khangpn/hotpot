1. Fix articles list security logic
1. Filter articles list by roles
1. Add/edit article roles

## Problems and Solutions
### Task 1

The query is so complicated to use *ORM*, so instead, I used the raw SQL query

    var query_string = 'SELECT "article"."id", "article"."name", "article"."description", "article"."content", "article"."writable", "article"."readable", "article"."created_at", "article"."updated_at", "article"."account_id", "article"."project_id", "article"."security_level_id",' +
    '"security_level"."id" AS "security_level.id", "security_level"."name" AS "security_level.name", "security_level"."level" AS "security_level.level", "security_level"."description" AS "security_level.description", "security_level"."created_at" AS "security_level.created_at", "security_level"."updated_at" AS "security_level.updated_at"' +
    ', "role".id AS "role.id", "role".name AS "role.name", "role".description AS "role.description"' +
    ' FROM "article" AS "article"' +
    ' INNER JOIN "security_level" AS "security_level" ON "article"."security_level_id" = "security_level"."id" AND ("security_level"."level" <= :level OR "article"."account_id" = :account_id)' +
    ' INNER JOIN "article_role" AS "article_role" ON "article"."id" = "article_role"."article_id"' +
    ' INNER JOIN "role" AS "role" ON "article_role"."role_id" = "role"."id"' +
    ' WHERE ("article"."project_id" = :project_id AND ("article"."readable" = true OR "article"."account_id" = :account_id))' +
    '';
    sequelize.query(query_string, {
      replacements: {
        level: project_profile.security_level.level,
        account_id: project_profile.account_id,
        project_id: project_profile.project_id
      },
      type: sequelize.QueryTypes.SELECT
    })
    .then(
      function(articles) {
        res.render("list", {articles: articles});
      }, function(error) {
        return next(error);
      }); 

If we use `"role".*`,
there will be query error as missing something from `FROM` clause,
so we have to declare all the atrributes.

### Task 2
#### LEARNING

We can eager load the m:m relation in sequelize by using `as` keyword

    Article.findById(article_id, {
      include: [SecurityLevel, Project, 
        {
          model: Role,
          as: 'roles'
        }
      ]
    })

NOTE: With this kind of eager loading, after the object is updated, if there are any errors,
the array of *associating objects* will be changed.
The number of *associating objects* is still remained, but their *children data values* will be empty.
In order to reverse this, we can use `previous`

    article.roles = article.previous('roles');

### Task 3
#### LEARNING

We can add associations to an instance of m:m relation by using `set<Something>([<array of association>])`.
It will delete the old associations and add new one.
You can provide an array of associating objects or just an array of association id

    article.setRoles(data.roles).then(
      function(roles) {                                                                                                                                          
        res.redirect('/articles/' + article.id);
    });
