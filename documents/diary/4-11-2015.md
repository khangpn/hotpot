1. Apply twitter bootstrap to the view
2. Style the account create page
3. Check Account password confirmation
4. Check Account AccountDetail validation and print error

## Problems and Solutions
### Task 3

Can not compare `password` again `password_confirm`, have to do the reverse way

    validations: {
      password_confirm: [
        orm.enforce.sameAs("password", "Confirmed password is not matched")
      ]
    },

### Task 4 

- There is no Model.isValid in ORM2, so I cannot check the Account and AccountValidation before creating.
- The sittuation is that when I create `Account` and `AccountDetail`, if `Account` has errors, it will skip validating `AccountDetail`.
- If the `Account` is valid, it will be saved regardless `AccountDetail` is failed to create.
- There is a tweak about `Account`, although the `name`  field is set `unique: true`, it still save to DB with duplicated name.

NO SOLUTION YET.

#### LEARNING

- ORM2 does not support `Model.isValid`.
- ORM2 validation is not reliable, and way complicated.
- Considering to move to Sequelize.js
