1. Fix the `setup-model.js` to ignore swp files.
2. Add `account_detail` model, and create its relation to `account`
3. Create account `create` and `view` page.
4. Create new account and related details by html form.

## Problems and Solutions
### Task 2 + 4
#### LEARNING

We can make 2 ways `hasOne` and `belongTo` relationship of 2 models by using `reverse` option.

    // This is read 'AccountDetail belongs to Account'.
    // Because ORM2 only has hasOne for both has and belong.
    AccountDetail.hasOne("account", db.models.account, {reverse: 'account_detail'});

We we create an `Account` instance, ORM2 can create the `AccountDetail` for us at the same time by using nested object. 

    Account.create(data, function (err, newAcc) {...});

  where the data is

    { name: 'khang',
      password: 'dsafdasfwaefasd',
      account_detail: { 
        fullname: 'nguyen phuc khang',
        email: 'khang@hotpot.com' 
      } 
    }

  and we can set the `input` tag in the `form` as

    input(type='text', name='account_detail[fullname]')

### Task 3
#### LEARNING

- The sub-views (nested views) included by using jade `include` can access the parameters which are provided in controller without having to re-assign when `include`
