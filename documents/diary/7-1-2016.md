1. Filter the articles list by current account roles
2. Check the role for viewing article
3. Fix article readable is not set to false when unticked
4. Fix the article edit logic, any accounts with same security can edit it while it is writable
5. Create models for ticket feature
6. Add tickets controller
7. Create ticket

## Problems and Solutions
### Task 1

Check if the article has `roles` `IN` user `roles` list

    var account_roles_query = ''; 
    var account_roles = project_profile.roles;
    for (var i = 0; i < account_roles.length; i++) {
      account_roles_query += account_roles[i].id.toString();                                                                                                       
      if (i < account_roles.length - 1)
        account_roles_query += ',';
    }

    var query_string = 'SELECT "article"."id", "article"."name", "article"."description", "article"."content", "article"."writable", "article"."readable", "article
    '"security_level"."id" AS "security_level.id", "security_level"."name" AS "security_level.name", "security_level"."level" AS "security_level.level", "security_
    //', "role".id AS "role.id", "role".name AS "role.name", "role".description AS "role.description"' +
    ' FROM "article" AS "article"' +
    ' INNER JOIN "security_level" AS "security_level" ON "article"."security_level_id" = "security_level"."id" AND ("security_level"."level" <= :level OR "article"
    ' INNER JOIN "article_role" AS "article_role" ON "article"."id" = "article_role"."article_id"' +
    ' INNER JOIN "role" AS "role" ON "article_role"."role_id" = "role"."id"' +
    ' WHERE ("article"."project_id" = :project_id AND (("article"."readable" = true AND "article_role"."role_id" IN (:account_roles_query)) OR "article"."account_i
    ' GROUP BY "article"."id", "security_level.id", "article_role"."article_id"';
    //'';
    sequelize.query(query_string, {
      replacements: {
        level: project_profile.security_level.level,
        account_id: project_profile.account_id,
        account_roles_query: account_roles_query,
        project_id: project_profile.project_id
      },  
      type: sequelize.QueryTypes.SELECT
    })  
    .then(
      function(articles) { res.render("list", {articles: articles});
      }, function(error) {
        return next(error);
      });

### Task 2

Create another route for the view path.
The viewing logic is if the user is owner then he can view it no matter what.
With the other accounts, they and the article should have at least one role in common to be able to view it.
Using intersection_destristructible to get the common.

    var article = res.locals.current_article;
    var current_account = res.locals.current_account;
    if (article.account.id == current_account.id) {
      res.locals.current_article = article;
      return next();
    }   

    var project_profile = res.locals.current_profile;
    var article_roles = article.roles;
    var profile_roles = project_profile.roles;

    var article_roles_array = []; 
    for (var i = 0; i < article_roles.length; i++) {
      article_roles_array.push(article_roles[i].id);
    }   
    article_roles_array.sort();

    var profile_roles_array = []; 
    for (var i = 0; i < profile_roles.length; i++) {
      profile_roles_array.push(profile_roles[i].id);
    }   
    profile_roles_array.sort();

    var result = util.array_inter(article_roles_array, 
      profile_roles_array);

    if (result.length == 0)
      return util.handle_unauthorized(next);
    return next();

#### LEARNING

This is an algorithm to get the common elements between 2 sorted array.

    var intersection_destructive = function (a, b) {
      var result = new Array();
      while( a.length > 0 && b.length > 0 ) 
      {   
         if      (a[0] < b[0] ){ a.shift(); }
         else if (a[0] > b[0] ){ b.shift(); }
         else /* they are equal */
         {   
           result.push(a.shift());
           b.shift();
           }   
        }   
  
      return result;
    }

### Task 4

If an account has the same security level with an article,
he should be able to read it, so that allow him to edit the content is reasonable.

### Task 5

Add `ticket`, `ticket_role`, `priority` models, and config the others to make them associated.

### Task 7
#### LEARNING

In `models`, when declare associations, the `as` operator is also used to distinguish which association to load when `include`.
It could be illustrated in case there are 2 associations of a model to another model.

    Ticket.belongsTo(models.account, {
      as: 'owner',
      onDelete: "CASCADE",
      foreignKey: {
        allowNull: false
      }
    });
    Ticket.belongsTo(models.account, {
      as: 'assignee',
      onDelete: "CASCADE",
      foreignKey: {
        allowNull: false
      }
    });

And in the `account` model, we can declare the association as

    Account.hasMany(models.ticket, {
      as: 'tasks',
      onDelete: "CASCADE",
      foreignKey: 'assignee_id'
    });
    Account.hasMany(models.ticket, {
      as: 'opened_tickets',
      onDelete: "CASCADE",
      foreignKey: 'owner_id'
    });

So, as we mentioned in previous diary, `belongsTo` will add the `fk` to the current model,
we can set the specific name for them.
And any `has` methods whose `fk` is defined will know which `fk` is used to link to that correct association.

Then, in controller we can include them like this

    Ticket.findById(ticket_id, {
      include: [
        {
          model: req.models.account,
          as: 'owner'
        },
        {
          model: req.models.account,
          as: 'assignee',
          require: false
        },
        req.models.security_level,
        req.models.project,
        {
          model: Role,
          as: 'roles'
        }
      ]
