## Problems and Solutions
### Task 1

If we use Sequelize raw query to get the data, then we need to declare what we want to get from the associations so that Sequelize will load it to the Object.
and the key of those attributes will be the `<association_name>.<col_name>`

    var query_string = 'SELECT "ticket"."id", "ticket"."name", "ticket"."content", "ticket"."due_date", "ticket"."writable", "ticket"."readable", "ticket"."created_at", "ticket"."updated_at", "ticket"."owner_id", "ticket"."assignee_id", "ticket"."project_id", "ticket"."security_level_id"' +
    ', "owner"."id" AS "owner.id", "owner"."name" AS "owner.name"' +
    ', "assignee"."id" AS "assignee.id", "assignee"."name" AS "assignee.name"' +
    ' FROM "ticket" AS "ticket"' +
    ' INNER JOIN "security_level" AS "security_level" ON "ticket"."security_level_id" = "security_level"."id" AND ("security_level"."level" <= :level OR "ticket"."owner_id" = :owner_id)' +
    ' INNER JOIN "ticket_role" AS "ticket_role" ON "ticket"."id" = "ticket_role"."ticket_id"' +
    ' INNER JOIN "role" AS "role" ON "ticket_role"."role_id" = "role"."id"' +
    ' INNER JOIN "account" AS "owner" ON "ticket"."owner_id" = "owner"."id"' +
    ' INNER JOIN "account" AS "assignee" ON "ticket"."assignee_id" = "assignee"."id"' +
    ' WHERE ("ticket"."project_id" = :project_id AND (("ticket"."readable" = true AND "ticket_role"."role_id" IN (:account_roles_query)) OR "ticket"."owner_id" = :owner_id))' +
    ' GROUP BY "ticket"."id", "ticket_role"."ticket_id", "owner.id", "assignee.id"';

Then we can get the `owner.id` by 

    ticket['owner.id']
