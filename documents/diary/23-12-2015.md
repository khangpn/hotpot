# December 1st - December 23rd, 2015

1. Add article model
1. Add access control to controllers.

## Problems and Solutions
### Task 1
- Articles belong to different projects.
So that, only users in each projects can view its articles.
- The article now will have many `roles`, one `security_level`, `readable` and `writable` options.
- `readable` will allow higher `security_level` users and its owner to read the content.
- `writable` will allow users with the same `security_level` and its owner to edit the content.
- Everyone can create articles in higher or equal `security_level`.
- Not filtered by `roles` yet.
#### LEARNING
- `belongsTo` will add the foreign key to the current model, while `hasOne` or `hasMany` will add the fk to the relating model. 

### Task 2
So many complex query and comparison.
Now I separate the access control and the response into two separate middlewares for every route as route stacks.

    router.get('/create', function(req, res, next) {
      if (!res.locals.isAdmin) {
        var err = new Error('You are not permitted to access this!');
        err.status = 401;
        return next(err);
      }
      res.render("create");
    });

#### LEARNING
- With m:m relation, we should query on the relation table instead of the end tables.
