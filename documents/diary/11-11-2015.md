1. Design the association among Account, Project, Role and Level.
1. Design Project, Role, Level Model

## Problems and Solutions
### Task 1 

I decided that `Account-Project` is *m:m* relation. And every *account* will have many different *roles*, and one *security level* in each of the projects they wor on.
It could be illustrated as:

- Account-Project (m:m)
- AccountProject-Role (m:m)
- AccountProject-Level (m:1)

### Task 2

- Account-Project (m:m). It is translated to Sequelize association as 'Account belongsToMany Project' and 'Project belongsToMany Account'.
- AccountProject-Level(m:1). It is translated to Sequelize association as 'AccountProject belongsTo Level' and 'Level hasMany AccountProject'.
- AccountProject-Role (m:m). It is translated to Sequelize association as 'AccountProject belongsToMany Role' and 'Role belongsToMany AccountProject'.

#### LEARNING

- Sequelize association must be defined from both models in order to make them `include` each other when query.
