There is no diaries on 6th and 7th because I worked on those days but cannot come to any solutions, so there were not any new things to report.

Today achievement

1. Created a branch *sequelize* to start immigarting *sequelize* in replacement to *orm2*.
2. Modified models defination.
3. Add some validations.

## Problems and Solutions
### Task 2 + 3
- There are so many options related to *not null* in Sequelize

    password: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
      allownNull: false //in model attribute defination
      ...
      validate: {
        notNull: true //in model attribute validate
        ...
      }
    }

It turned out that if `notNull` is deprecated by the `allowNull` if we define them both.
So I *removed* the `notNull`.

- The model still saved to DB even though I left the password field empty, and set its `allowNull: false`.

So when we leave the field empty it will take empty string `''` as the value and they do not violate the rule.
In this case, instead, we have to check

    validate: {
      ...
      notEmpty: true
    }

- I needed a password_confirm field to check against the password, but I do not want to create that in DB, nor save them.

So I have to create the field with the `type: DataType.VIRTUAL`

      password_confirm: { 
        type: DataTypes.VIRTUAL,
        allowNull: false,
        validate: {
          notEmpty: true,
          len: [8, 128]
        }
      },

It create a virtual column which is not in the DB.

#### LEARNING

- Sequelize migration can be done with `sequelize-cli` and its config file is 

    var path = require('path')
     
    module.exports = {
      'config': path.resolve('config', 'database.js'),
      'models-path': path.resolve('models')
    }
