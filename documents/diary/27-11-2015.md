1. Change models to apply new relation among accounts, projects, roles and security level.
1. Update the controller for the model changes

## Problems and Solutions
### Task 1
Now the relation model among accounts, projects, roles and security level is defined as:

- An *account* can belong to many projects.
- Every members (accounts) in a project will have many roles (belong to many categories),
and their roles are differred by each of different projects.
- Every members (accounts) in a project will have only one security level,
and it is also differred by each of different projects.

For example, *account* A could join two projects. 
In the first project, his roles are programmer, team leader and his security level is secret. 
While in another project, he is a designer with his security is normal.

I decided to switch to this solution because it is more flexible than the old design where every account will have only one security level and a fixed number of roles for all the projects.
#### LEARNING
There are some useful options in model defination of Sequelize

      underscored: true, //create table using underscored format
      freezeTableName: true, //do not change table name to plural form

Additional *model function* will be named after the `as` option in model definition

      Role.belongsToMany(models.account_project, {
        through: models.account_role,
        as: "accounts" // add getAccounts, addAccount, etc...
      });
