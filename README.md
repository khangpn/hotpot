# HotPot - Master Thesis of Information Security - "MLS in Project Management"
## Abstract
In IT industry, in term of project management, there are various choices of solution for management tools \eg Redmine, FreshDesk, ProjectLibre, LibrePlan, OpenProject, ProjectOpen etc... They can cover most of organization's needs, including security. However, at the time of writing this document, none of those solutions covers protecting information in a multi level environment, \ie many roles, \eg developers, designer, manager, CEO etc..., working on a same system, which is a typical situation in most of companies. 

This project's idea is to create a web platform for project management using MLS. Many organizations (either small or big size) can benefit from this project in order to control work flow, data related to their works. Since using MLS sometimes is complicated and expensive to implement, the goal of this project is to help organizations to benefit from MLS work flow while reducing its complexity. The key feature of this tool is to control accessibility of documents of an organization where many subjects with various roles can work and share documents centrally; the list of advantages using MLS will be introduced in more details in later chapter.
